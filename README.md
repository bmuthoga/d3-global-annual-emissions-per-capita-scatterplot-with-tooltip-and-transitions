# Global Annual Emissions per Capita Scatterplot
This is a scatterplot representing `Global Methane vs CO2 Emissions per Capita`, from the year `1990` to `2012`, built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

Hovering over each scatterplot, either by `mouseover` or `touchstart` events, displays a `tooltip` with detailed emissions info for that specific nation during the selected annual year

The scatterplots' `color scale` (`black -> green`) represents the nations' `renewable energy` (`low -> high`), while their `radius scale` (`5 -> 30`) represents the nations' `urban population ratio of the total population` (`low -> high`)

The data used has been sourced and compiled from [UN data](https://data.un.org/)

The app, and online editor, can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-global-annual-emissions-per-capita-scatterplot-with-tooltip-and-transitions-edb2y)
